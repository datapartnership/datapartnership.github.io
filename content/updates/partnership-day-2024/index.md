The Partnership Day is an exclusive event where tech leaders such as Nathan Naido, **Meta's** Director of Public Policy, and Dr. Jason Hickey, **Google's** Head of Research, will share insights on how private-sector collaborations and AI can help tackle development challenges. Additionally, Sophie Schmidt, Founder and Publisher of **Rest of World** will offer a unique perspective on how AI impacts developing countries.

Hear how project collaborations between private companies and international organizations, such as Meta, LinkedIn, Plume Labs, JBA, Planet, EBRD, OECD, IMF, IDB, and the World Bank, reshape how we address international development.
