In its [Sustainable Development Strategy—Vision 2030](https://mped.gov.eg/EgyptVision?lang=en), the Government of Egypt recognized that affordable digital infrastructure is essential for a modern economy and that Egypt requires high-speed broadband connectivity to drive productivity, innovation, and growth. The strategy focuses on improving the quality of life of the Egyptian citizens and standard of living in various aspects, ensuring the consolidation of the principles of justice, social inclusion and the participation for all, in conjunction with high, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, enhancing investment in human beings, and promoting increased knowledge, innovation and scientific research in all areas.

## Challenge

Egypt has a large national broadband market with a population of just over 100 million inhabitants and benefits from a growing youth bulge. However broadband quality of service (QoS) and coverage has been a continuous concern in Egypt. From 2019, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technologies (MCIT) has invested $1.9bn in fixed infrastructure to enable better broadband connectivity in Egypt and increased the capacity of international gateways by over 50%. The need for good quality digital services was further fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic that accelerated their uptake and acceptance.

## Solution

The Digital Development Team at the World Bank leveraged [Ookla’s Speedtest Intelligence data](https://www.speedtest.net/about) to analyze the infrastructure and broadband connectivity in the country and provide recommendations on the [Egypt Digital Economy Country Assessment (DECA) report](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/b7a35868206ace761909f9bd2daa1f91-0200022021/original/Digital-Economy-Country-Assessment-May-26-Final.pdf).

**The team’s analysis found that:**

In the provision of fixed broadband services, fixed broadband operators (FBB) rely on Telecom Egypt (TE), the incumbent’s legacy copper access network in so called ‘brownfield’ areas.[<sup>1</sup>](#note1) Improvement in fixed broadband quality of service was evident since the beginning of 2019, as a result of TE’s investments in fiber to the curb (FTTC) and access network upgraded to very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) technology, as shown in figure 1.

</figure>

FBB operators further worked to maintain adequate connectivity at home to accommodate the increase of home internet usage that went up by 87% between mid-March and mid-April 2020 (driven by the usage of digital platforms such as e-learning to maintain education upon school closure during the pandemic). The average fixed broadband speeds increased from 6.7 Mbps in December 2018 to 34.9 Mbps in December 2020 (figure 2) and latency was cut in half (a performance evolution that coincide with the capacity increase of international gateways).

While there are around 8.81 million users of fixed broadband services, mobile devices remain the primary means by which people access the broadband internet in Egypt [<sup>2</sup>](#note2) with mobile broadband internet subscription of 52.0 million and USB Modem subscriptions of 4.04 million. The QoS of mobile broadband had not made similar improvement over the 12 months period considered in figure 2 while data usage has steadily increased since mobile network operators (MNOs) launched 4G services in 2017, and further increased by 35 percent due to COVID-19 mitigation measures.

</figure>

To obtain similar significant QoS improvement as with fixed broadband, a number of options are available for the government of Egypt’s consideration, including i) increase the amount of spectrum assigned to MNOs, ii) facilitate the possibility for MNOs to use to fiber infrastructure to connect telecom towers to their core networks and iii) facilitate the deployment of new mobile sites to improve mobile broadband coverage.

</figure>

The coverage map of 3G/4G[<sup>3</sup>](#note3) broadband access (figure 3) measured by MNOs speed tests shows that while the largest cities have good coverage, the rest of the country remains underserved, and quality of mobile broadband remains limited for communication needs in rural and less populated remote areas.

## Impact

The analysis from the Digital Development Team informed the recommendations provided in the DECA report. The recommendations seek to support achieving the vision of making high-speed broadband available to every citizen, business and private institution in Egypt by year 2030.

The government of Egypt continues to take important development measures [<sup>4</sup>](#note4) to increase the QoS and coverage of mobile broadband networks, as evidenced by the recent assignment of new spectrum to MNOs in late 2020 and a new regulatory framework for licensing and lease mobile tower construction via private and international partners. Improved mobile broadband services will promote greater demand, help e-government services scale, ensure business continuity (particularly in crisis situations), and strengthen the overall attractiveness of Egypt’s digital market.
