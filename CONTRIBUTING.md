# Contributing

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the Development Data Partnership! ðŸŽ‰

The [Development Data Partnership Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/) website is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-generated static website that is continuously deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). If not familiar with Hugo, please check out a [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

In summary, the continuous deployment (CD) works as follows:

- On each new pull request, a preview will be available. The deploy preview will be posted by the `netlify bot` on the comments.

- On each commit to `main`, the website is published to [datapartnership.org](https://datapartnership.org). The domain is registed AWS Route 53 with the World Bank.
