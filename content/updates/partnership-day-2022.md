This day is dedicated to addressing global climate, health, and food security challenges through public-private data science collaboration. Speakers from LinkedIn, Google, Meta, Spectus (formerly Cuebiq), Ookla, and Mapbox will share their latest experiences on data science collaboration for public good, while leadership and colleagues from the IDB, UNDP, IMF, and the World Bank will introduce project impacts. Presentations will be followed by a Call to Action, inviting participants to learn about and join an experimental, global data science collaboration to address urgent needs.

**The Development Data Partnership Day is on Friday, October 28, 2022, from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PT at the LinkedIn HQ in San Francisco.
