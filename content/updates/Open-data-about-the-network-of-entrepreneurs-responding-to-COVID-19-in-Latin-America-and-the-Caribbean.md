**Challenge**: The social and economic disruption caused by Covid-19 has led numerous of challenges to conduct businesses; provide essential services as well as attending the most basic well being needs around the globe. This complex scenario brought by the pandemic fostered entrepreneurs in Latin America and Caribbean to provide solutions ranging from education and remote work; mental health services to digital solutions for the management and monitoring of quarantine; support for diagnostic logistics, and much more. However, most of the entrepreneursâ€™ works were decentralized and sometimes disconnected from other initiatives that could attend and assist many diverse necessities from citizens.  In response to this problem, members of IDB Lab organized and mapped all these business attempts to stimulate collaboration in the region.

**Solution**: IDB Lab valued these tremendous efforts from small businesses and entrepreneurs and created [The Map of LAC Innovators COVID-19](https://bidlab.org/es/map-LAC-innovators-Covid-19), which allows people to explore an interactive map of an open, united and consolidated database of the diverse efforts of startups around the region. The map uses ArcGIS online platform (provided by the Data Parntership) to hover the data and publish a geographic map quickly and easily. The authors of the projects also provided access to download their data by entering on this [link](https://github.com/datapartnership/IDB-Lab-Map-LAC-Innovators-Coronavirus).

**Impact**: The Map aggregates more than 500 business initiatives across Latin America representing roughly 26 countries in the region. More than 16 categories were described and cataloged in which resulted on an immersive and knowledgeable platform for people to easily discover ongoing initiatives spurring more collaboration among businesses and society.
