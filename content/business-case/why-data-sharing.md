Provision of public infrastructure and services is heavily dependent on data – higher quality, timely data translates into more effective project design, implementation, and evaluation. Traditional methods for public sector data collection can be inefficient – for example, in the transport sector, travel times are often estimated using stopwatches, and common origin-destination pairs are derived through decennial household surveys.

Increasingly, the private sector is generating data that could be re-purposed to complement traditional public-sector data collection methods – for example, using fleet GPS data to estimate speeds or mobile operator data to determine travel patterns.

Rather than expend public resources collecting data that is already collected, the public sector should seek the comparative advantage of the private sector. In so doing, entirely new public good use cases could be discovered and implemented.
