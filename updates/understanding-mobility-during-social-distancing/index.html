This list has since <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do/brief/world-bank-group-operational-response-covid-19-coronavirus-projects-list>expanded</a>.</p><p>We will focus on India, one of the countries receiving COVID-19 support. However, this will work for any country where data is available.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with exploring public mobility data from <a href=https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility>Apple</a> and <a href=https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>Google</a>.</p><h3 id=apple-mobility-data>Apple mobility data</h3><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_10_0.png alt=png></p><p>Apple&rsquo;s data is activity based, recording when people were walking and when they were driving. We can clearly see a sharp decline in walking / data activity recorded by Apple devices at the end of March. People with a higher income tend to own Apple devices. We can see this trend on the NYT study above, and below we also explore this hypothesis for India using Google and Facebook data.</p><p>Lastly, we see that in early May, people are starting to drive and walk more.</p><h3 id=google-mobility-data>Google mobility data</h3><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_14_0.png alt=png></p><p>Google&rsquo;s data is less about activity and more about location. How much time did people spend in a given location?</p><p>Note the changes after the end of March:</p><ul><li>An increase in time spent in residential locations (people staying at home)</li><li>An overall decrease in Retail, Grocery, Parks, Transit and Workplaces.</li></ul><p>However, once the initial drop happened, we still observe:</p><ul><li>Spikes in Workplaces. People across a wider diversity of incomes own Android phones. Based on this chart, there are still a good number of people going back to their workplaces.</li><li>A drop in trips to retail locations, with a slight incrase in trips to grocery locations. From this, we can infer that people are decreasing retail spending and saving the money for groceries.</li></ul><h3 id=comparing-apple-and-google-data>Comparing Apple and Google Data</h3><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_17_0.png alt=png></p><p>Comparing Apple&rsquo;s activity data with Google location data, we make a few more observations:</p><ul><li>An increase in people staying in residential locations is [correctly] correlated with people walking and driving less.</li><li>The slightly increasing driving and walking rates towards the beginning of May could potentially be related to a slight uptick of trips to the grocery store.</li></ul><h2 id=adding-in-facebook-mobility-data>Adding in Facebook mobility data</h2><p>We are going to start with Facebook&rsquo;s new <a href=https://devdatapartnership.herokuapp.com/Facebook.html#Movement-Range-maps>Movement Range</a> data. This is not available to the general public, but it is available through the <a href=https://datapartnership.org/>Data Partnership</a>. Submit a project proposal to use it!</p><p>Facebook Movement Range data contains two types of data:</p><ul><li><strong>Mobility Range</strong>: The degree of movement. How many map tiles were touched by users, relative to a baseline in the last months.</li><li><strong>Stationary Share</strong>: The percentage of users always on the same map tile, relative to a baseline last months.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s explore first the relation between them on a scatter plot:</p><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_27_0.png alt=png></p><p>It seems clear, and logical, that there is a proportional relation: The more stationary a region is, the less movement range we see. A higher cluster around <code>0</code> (no relative change), means that in these regions, there is more variability of stationary populations.</p><p>We also see that some regions tend to be in the same space of the plot, especially the most compliant with the lockdown.</p><hr><h3 id=mobility-range>Mobility range</h3><p>This data shows the average number of level 16 Bing tiles (0.6km by 0.6km) that a Facebook user (mobile app + location history) was present in during a 24 hour period compared to pre-crisis levels. This is called the Travel Range map.</p><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_30_0.png alt=png></p><p>ALL regions see a significant decrease in range. The degree of change seems mostly constant, and some places twice than others.</p><hr><h3 id=stationary-share>Stationary share</h3><p>Percentage of Facebook users (mobile app + location history) that were present in only one such level 16 Bing tile in at least 3 different hours of the day.</p><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_35_1.png alt=png></p><p>We see that some regions see little change, while others see <code>~x15</code> increase. The capital &ldquo;NCT of Delhi&rdquo; is the region with the highest increase of stationay users, while Himachal Pradesh, a remote mountainous region varely saw any change.</p><hr><h3 id=break-up-by-indian-state>Break up by Indian State</h3><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_38_0.png alt=png></p><h2 id=comparing-apple-google-and-facebook-data>Comparing Apple, Google and Facebook data</h2><p><img src=/updates/mobility-metrics-in/output_40_0.png alt=png></p><p>Apple mobility data (solid colored lines) tend to show among the strongest reduction of mobility, consistent with wealthier customers that can afford Apple products and can also work from home or restrict their mobility.</p><p>Google mobility data (dotted colored lines) breaks down mobility. We can see strongest reduction of mobility in retail and transit, comparable to Apple data. Groceries and workplaces remain with 40% mobility versus the baseline.</p><p>Facebook data (black crosses and stars) is broken down into states, and shows a significant range. This is expected as some states are largely rural and some urban, with different livelihoods and mobility patterns.</p><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>In this post, you have learned how to work with <a href=https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility>Apple</a>, <a href=https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>Google</a>, and <a href=https://devdatapartnership.herokuapp.com/Facebook.html#Movement-Range-maps>Facebook Movement Range</a> data.</p><p>We compared the three data sources, and discussed potential bias and its implications in mobility data.</p><p>If you are a Development Partner, and would like to use Data Partnership data, submit a project!</p><p>If you are a Data Provider and want to see your data be used for world-changing impact, <a href=mailto:datapartnership@worldbank.org>sign up to work</a> with the Data Partnership!</p><hr><p>Note: All the code to replicate the analysis and plots, is <a href=https://github.com/datapartnership/covid19/blob/master/Mobility%20metrics-India.ipynb>available here</a>.</p><p><em>Authors:</em></p><ul><li><a href=https://maksimpecherskiy.com><em>Maksim Pecherskiy</em></a> <em>Lead Data Engineer, Development Data Partnership</em></li><li><a href=https://brunosan.eu/><em>Bruno Sanchez-Andrade Nuno</em></a> <em>Lead Data Science Advisor, Development Data Partnership</em></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-3 offset-md-1 col-xs-12"><div class="bg-secondary text-light p-3"><h4 class=mb-4>You can also read</h4><hr><dl><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/climacell-24-hour-hackathon-to-help-address-the-locust-spread-in-africa-and-beyond/>Leveraging New Data Methods to Address an Ancient Challenge: Locusts</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/find-population-movement-data-for-your-country/>How to Find Population Movement Data for Your Country: The Mobile Location Data Inventory</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/understanding-mobility-during-social-distancing/>Google, Apple, and Facebook: Understanding Mobility during Social Distancing with Private Sector Data</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/covid19-and-public-private-data-partnerships/>Addressing COVID-19 through Public-Private Data Partnerships -- Where Do We Put New Testing Facilities?</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/more-accurate-electrical-grid-mapping/>A New Predictive Model for More Accurate Electrical Grid Mapping</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/employment-opportunities-in-bangladesh/>Estimating Access to Employment Opportunities in Dhaka, Bangladesh</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/tackling-the-global-profitarchy/>Tackling the Global Profitarchy–Gender and the Choice of Business Sector</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/why-datacollaboratives/>Why Data Partnership?</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/improving-road-safety-in-nairobi/>Improving Road Safety in Nairobi</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/responsible-data-use/>On Responsible Data Use</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/mapping-freetown-transit/>Mapping Freetown Transit for Resiliency</a></dt><dt class=pb-4><a class="h5 text-light" href=/updates/data-day/>Data Partner Lightning Talks</a></dt></dl></div></div></div></div></section></div></div><footer><div class="container-fluid pb-4"><div class=row><div class=col-12><a class="footer-image p-4" href=https://www.iadb.org/en><img class=img-fluid src=//datapartnership.org/idb.svg alt=IDB></a>
