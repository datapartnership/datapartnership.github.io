Collaboration between technology companies and international organizations is crucial in today's evolving international development landscape. Public-private partnerships facilitate the exchange of expertise and promote innovative solutions to tackle emerging global challenges.

This year’s [Development Data Partnership (Partnership) Day](https://datapartnership.org/updates/partnership-day-2025/) underscored the critical importance of leveraging the Partnership’s strong technical, legal, and governance frameworks to drive impact and respond effectively to an increasingly complex development environment.

The event took place on June 17, 2025, at the Google NYC Office located at St. John's Terminal. It gathered tech companies, multilateral organizations, and members of the data community to exchange insights on leveraging data collaboration for the public good. The event also presented new perspectives through impactful stories and presentations that demonstrated how transforming data can inspire meaningful action.

Megan Ryskamp, Director of Social Impact Partnerships at Google, began the event by highlighting the use of Google technologies to connect partners in addressing pressing challenges, emphasizing the importance of creating solutions through these connections. Next, Marco Marini, Division Chief at the International Monetary Fund, highlighted how the Partnership enhances development outcomes by facilitating data sharing between the private sector and public organizations, as well as addressing barriers to data access and usage.

The Partnership has supported over 400 proposals covering 24 sectors across 190 countries and territories and is currently focusing on sharing code and methodologies, as highlighted by Holly Krambeck, Program Manager at the World Bank, who updated the audience on the Partnership's work. She stated that the Partnership has successfully created code packages that can be reused by other organizations and partners.
