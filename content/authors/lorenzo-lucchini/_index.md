Lorenzo Lucchini is a postdoctoral research fellow at Bocconi University and a research fellow at the Center for Health Emergencies (Bruno Kessler Foundation). He also serves as a data science consultant for the World Bank, where he applies advanced data analytics to monitor the impact of public policies, such as COVID-19 responses, using human mobility data and other big data sources.
His research leverages mathematical modelling and statistical analysis to understand coordination and collective behaviour dynamics, with a focus on issues such as vaccine hesitancy, information diffusion, and public health policy. By utilizing data streams from social media and mobile phones, Lorenzo provides insights into how societies adapt to challenges, forming conventions and norms in response to changing circumstances.

Lorenzo holds a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in complex systems and computational social science, and an MSc in Theoretical Physics. His expertise spans topics critical to global development, from behavioural epidemiology to migration and human mobility trends.
