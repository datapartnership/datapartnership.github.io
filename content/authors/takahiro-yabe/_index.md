Takahiro ‘Taka’ Yabe is a Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and Media Lab working with Alex ‘Sandy’ Pentland and Esteban Moro. Taka’s research develops tools and models for analyzing large-scale human behavior data to better understand collective social dynamics during disruptions, and to improve the resilience of communities and cities to urban shocks (e.g., disasters, pandemics, and disruptive technology). His recent works on modeling the resilience of complex urban sociotechnical systems to natural hazards, human behavior analysis during and after disasters and pandemics, and geospatial AI for cross-city learning, have been published in journals such as Nature Machine Intelligence, PNAS, and Sustainable Cities and Society. As a Data Science Consultant for GFDRR and World Bank, he has worked on human mobility data analytics for urban disaster risk management and transportation resilience modeling in India, Mexico, and Nepal. He received his Ph.D. from Purdue University, and Masters and Bachelor Degrees from the University of Tokyo.
