**Background** 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, the World Bank is ramping up its response to help countries around the world. The Bank recently announced [$14 billion emergency support program](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/03/17/world-bank-group-increases-covid-19-response-to-14-billion-to-help-sustain-economies-protect-jobs), for which a key pillar is to help countries strengthen their capacity to monitor and respond to the spread of the virus. Countries like China, South Korea, and Singapore have effectively leveraged big data to do this -- with solutions like apps that track the transmission chains of confirmed cases or proactive alerts for people to get tested at a nearby facility. Big data has proven to be a critical tool for monitoring and responding to outbreaks.

The problem is, not all countries can easily benefit from big data, whether for lack of adequate infrastructure, technical capacity, financial resources, or needed regulatory policy. This is one of the reasons the World Bank, along with the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank, founded the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). The Partnership removes barriers to collaboration between the private sector and international organizations, so that members may pool private and open data to create “data goods” – insights and code that can be used by the public sector for good. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Development Data Partnership team members are working tirelessly to leverage big data to support our colleagues’ prevention, response, and recovery efforts. In this blog, we’ll look at a proof of concept for where big data could be used to predict where extra test facilities and hospital beds may be most needed.

**Solution**: Working with Where Is My Transport, map Freetown’s formal and informal transport network, and make the data freely available to governments, academia, and NGOs.

**Impact**: The local government can now identify and prioritize interventions that will enhance the resiliency of their transport system, to maximize economic and social benefits.
