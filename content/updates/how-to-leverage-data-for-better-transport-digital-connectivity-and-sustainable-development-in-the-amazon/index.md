The World Bank Transport team used data from [Google](https://www.google.com), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/), and [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good) to identify infrastructure gaps in the Amazon areas of Brazil, Colombia and Peru.


## Challenge

The Amazon is a region abundant in ecological and cultural wealth, yet it faces significant challenges in balancing the need for environmental protection with infrastructure development. Despite its richness, this region is one of the poorest in South America, with limited access to economic opportunities, essential services, and low living standards.

Boosting the bioeconomy, which involves economic activities safeguarding forests, can lead to sustainable livelihood improvements. However, this potential is hindered by significant infrastructure challenges: poor transportation networks, unreliable energy access, and limited digital connectivity. To realize the potential of its bioeconomy, we need to address these issues while protecting Amazon's unique ecosystems.

## Solution

Supported by the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (SFLAC), the World Bank leveraged open data from [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good) to reveal gaps in transport, digital access, and bioeconomy infrastructure in the Amazon areas of Brazil, Colombia and Peru. 

By analyzing satellite images, Google's [Open Buildings Dataset](https://sites.research.google/gr/open-buildings/?) (which helps estimate population density), OpenStreetMap, and mobile phone data (which indicates digital connectivity), the World Bank team discovered four main infrastructure clusters with different levels of connectivity.

For instance, they discovered that 5% of the areas are high connectivity/urban areas with strong transport and digital connections. They are the cities that serve as hubs for services, infrastructure, and commerce, but they are surrounded by numerous isolated communities. By increasing investment in these cities, we can transform them into drivers of regional development, helping to connect rural areas and promote inclusive growth throughout the Amazon.

In contrast, 9% of the areas have no connectivity/remote settlements. They lack transport or digital infrastructure, leading to severe isolation, although this has limited impact due to the low population. Without reliable access, the people living here face food shortages and economic challenges. Given the low population density, investments should prioritize affordable, scalable, and community-driven solutions to improve basic services and strengthen resilience.

Connectivity Distribution
•	High Connectivity/Urban Areas (5%)
•	Low Connectivity/Rural Area (60%)
•	No Connectivity/Remote Settlements (9%)
•	No Connectivity/Pristine Forests (26%)

The World Bank team also discovered that digital connectivity in the Amazon is significantly underdeveloped, showing major regional disparities. Using [Google](https://www.google.com)'s building footprint data (as a proxy for population density and development) and [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good)'s internet speed metrics, the World Bank found that only 8% of the Amazon benefits from high building density and high-speed internet.

Also, in the most remote areas, 38% of the Amazon has low building density and low internet speed, showing severe connectivity issues for dispersed communities.  Additionally, 42% of the region lacks comprehensive data coverage, making it difficult to assess digital infrastructure needs.

For this Amazon project, the team also utilized [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/) Movement Data and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Movement Data through the Development Data Partnership. The [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/) data included movement patterns and population density changes while the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) data included measuring activity remotely that enabled mapping activities on transportation or river networks.

## Impact

The data provided by [Google](https://www.google.com), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/), and [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good) was crucial for the World Bank team to identify both infrastructure challenges and investment opportunities. For instance, the team revealed the disparity in connectivity and the digital divide across the region.

Considering the Amazon’s vast and diverse landscape, infrastructure investments should be focused on the unique needs of each area to optimize impact and minimize environmental risks. Improving infrastructure in bioeconomy-rich areas can enhance supply chains and bolster food security, provided it safeguards biodiversity and adheres to conservation priorities.
