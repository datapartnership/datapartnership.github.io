**Challenge**: The social and economic disruption caused by Covid-19 has to led numerous challenges to conduct businesses, provide essential services, and attend to the most basic well-being needs around the globe. This complex scenario brought by the pandemic fostered entrepreneurs in Latin America and the Caribbean to provide solutions ranging from education and remote work; mental health services to digital solutions for the management and monitoring of quarantine; support for diagnostic logistics, and much more. However, most of the entrepreneursâ€™ efforts were decentralized and sometimes disconnected from other initiatives that could attend diverse necessities from citizens.  In response to this problem, IDB Lab members organized and mapped all these businesses' attempts to stimulate collaboration in the region.

**Solution**: IDB Lab valued these tremendous efforts from small businesses and entrepreneurs and created [The Map of LAC Innovators COVID-19](https://bidlab.org/es/map-LAC-innovators-Covid-19), which allows people to explore an interactive map of an open, united and consolidated database of the diverse startup efforts in the region. The map uses ESRI ArcGIS online platform (provided by the Data Partnership) to quickly and easily publish the data in a geographic map highlighting the efforts. The authors of the projects also provided access to download their data by entering on this [link](https://github.com/datapartnership/IDB-Lab-Map-LAC-Innovators-Coronavirus).

**Impact**: The Map aggregates more than 500 business initiatives across Latin America the Caribbean representing 26 countries in the region. More than 16 categories were described and cataloged, resulting in an immersive and knowledgeable platform for people to easily discover ongoing initiatives spurring more collaboration among businesses and society.
