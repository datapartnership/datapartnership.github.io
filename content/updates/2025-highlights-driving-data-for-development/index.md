2025 has been a year of meaningful progress for the Development Data Partnership. Together with our data and development partners, we have grown our community, expanded the scope and scale of project impacts, and promoted the responsible use of private sector data and AI models for development.

The Partnership has supported more than 100 projects in 2025, each contributing towards our shared Sustainable Development Goals. You can learn more about these through our published [impact stories]( https://datapartnership.org/updates/) that demonstrate the outcomes from public-private collaboration.  Check below is a list of this year’s impact stories that illustrate the power of collaboration. 

## Expanding Partnerships and Collaborations
In 2025, we have been excited to welcome [GrabMaps](https://grabmaps.grab.com/), [Kido Dynamics](https://www.kidodynamics.com/) and [Irys](https://irys.us/), who bring new sources of mobility and imagery, telecom, and location data to the Partnership, as well as technical expertise and a shared commitment to using data for the public good.

## Building a Global Generative AI Index
This year, the Partnership convened a roundtable of Chief Economists from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and LinkedIn, as well as Directors and Principal Researchers from Microsoft, Meta, and GitHub. Together, these competing companies agreed to collaborate on the first-of-its-kind program to measure global generative AI adoption. The initiative marks a new chapter in the Partnership's story, building on our governance, technical, and legal frameworks to build new, needed public data goods that individual organizations couldn't create on their own.

## Piloting Partnerships with Media Houses to Train AI Models on Under-Represented Languages
Nearly 4 billion people worldwide speak languages that do not have a sufficient internet presence to train generative AI models. To meet this challenge, the Partnership is extending its public-private data sharing model to governments, designing a system for partnering with media houses to build national digital language libraries for training AI models. The project, supported by the Gates Foundation, is being piloted in Malawi in collaboration with the Ministry of ICT and National Statistical Office, as well as the country's largest newspapers, broadcasters, and radio stations.

## Bringing the Data Community Together
A key highlight of 2025 has been this year’s [Development Data Partnership Day](https://datapartnership.org/updates/partnership-day-2025-leveraging-partnerships-for-the-public-good), held in June at Google’s New York office. The event brought together technology companies, multilateral institutions, and the broader data community to share project outcomes and explore how collaboration can accelerate progress toward global development goals amid changing priorities.

## Looking Ahead
As we approach 2026, we are excited to continue delivering on our new strategic goals. We are excited to advance the new Global Generative AI Index, and help governments unlock siloed underrepresented language media content for training AI models. We will continue to expand our outreach, strengthen existing partnerships, and foster new collaborations that will be essential to our journey ahead.

We are grateful for the continued enthusiasm for the Partnership and the remarkable work of our partners and the data community and cannot wait to see what you do next!

Thank you again for being an integral part of this remarkable 2025 journey.
