Jasper Verschuur is an assistant professor in engineering systems and climate security at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Jasper’s main research interests encompass quantifying the systemic risks that climate and non-climatic shocks pose to infrastructure systems and the essential services they provide to society. His research focuses on developing new modelling tools to better anticipate these risks and propose solutions to enhance resilience, spanning both local (e.g., household essential services) and global scale assessments (e.g., trade flows). He holds a PhD from the University of Oxford and MSc degrees in environmental policy (University of Oxford) and civil engineering (Delft University of Technology).
