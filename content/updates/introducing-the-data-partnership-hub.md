After rolling out the [Pilot Phase](/updates/why-datacollaboratives/) in 2018, the *Development Data Partnership* has scaled up fast, with more than 100 projects having been brought to life supported by partnerships with more than 20 companies.

From the very [beginning](/updates/data-day/), the *Partnership* has watched a growing interest and success using third-party data for economic development - especially where data scarcity poses extra challenges. Today, motivated by the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), we are supporting teams working on [confronting COVID-19 second wave](https://blogs.worldbank.org/eastasiapacific/confronting-covid-19-second-waves-how-big-data-good-can-inform-policy-vietnam), [mobility indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/poor-people-respond-differently-stay-home-orders-heres-what-data-says), [locust spread in Africa](https://www.climacell.org/blog/climacell-completes-24-hour-hackathon-to-help-address-the-locust-spread-in-africa-and-beyond/), [estimating access to employment opportunities](/updates/employment-opportunities-in-bangladesh/), healthcare accessibility, road safety, gender inequality, digital divide, food security and many others.

The key to expanding the success is to continue building up from the Partnership's pillars: **legal foundation**, **responsible  use**, **multi-disciplinary teams**, **secure architecture**, **data partnership management** and **data goods**. 

As more data partners and contributors join the initiative and more methodologies, results and derivative works are created, feeding them back to the community - with the curation of the *Partnership* â€“ will create a virtuous circle where common challenges, resources and expertise are shared and improved upon. 

To achieve the goal and to give the community a home, we are introducing the **Development Data Partnership Knowledge Hub**!

Inspired by the literate programming paradigm, the Knowledge Hub offers a centralized place for references, examples and collaboration alongside with reproducible macros and snippets explained in natural language.

Through the Data Partnership, you have access to a trove of data documentation, code snippets, collaboration tools and compute resources, all designed to help you get started on your project more quickly and effectively.

It lives on GitHub and on the [documentation](http://docs.datapartnership.org).

## Membership

We prepared a quick guide to get you started with.

- Learn more about the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/) and stay tuned for [updates](https://datapartnership.org/updates/).
- Create an account on GitHub.
- Become a member of the Partnership's organization on GitHub. If not, drop us a line.

Welcome! You're all set!

## Data Partner Documentation

Each *data partner* has a dedicated page on the documentation. 

<img src="/updates/data-partnership-knowledge-base/data-partnership-knowledge-base-partner.png" style="width:100%;"/><br>

 We are not reinventing the wheel; The documentation offers a centralized place for references and examples as well as details about the datasets, such as how to access the data (**Getting Access**), **Summary** and **Examples**.

In fact, that page has a double life and is a Jupyter notebook! You can either choose to work with it by cloning from the repository or by viewing a rendered page on your browser.

### Getting Access

After submitting your proposal to [Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/) and having it approved by the data partner, the section gives you details of how you should expect to get access to the data.

Even before your project take shape, the section helps estimate what kind what resources will be required from your team.

### Summary

The rationale for a data summary is to give a sneak peek into the datasets, even before submitting a project proposal.

For example, when exploring the mobile data opportunities, you will be able to see the number of records by geographic region and day by day, so you can evalulate the quality of the sampling of each Data Partner. Also, you will be able to compare those metrics from different partners, possibly deciding for one or a combination of datasets.

### Examples and Snippets

Taking an inspiration from *Don't repeat yourself (DRY)* principle, examples, snippets and facilitators are at the heart of what the documentation was brought to life.

An example of a facilitator that was created by Data Partership is for handling [Facebook](https://dataforgood.fb.com).

When downloading from Facebook GeoInsights, unfortunately, no API is available. Fortunately, the Data Partnership supports an easy alternative for programmatically download the files via the Facebook class on the *datapartnership* Python package.

After installing the package, you will be able to create a login session and download the files programmatically from your notebook. See more about the Facebook class on the [repository](https://github.com/datapartnership/ddp-docs-facebook).

## Tips and Tricks

As the name suggests, this section is where you can find tips and guides on how to set up common tools in projects, such as AWS, Python and environment variables.

## Collaboration

The Data Partnership is not only about licensing and data, but it is about sharing code, knowledge and building a community. That is why we take advantage of everything GitHub has to offer. 

You are more than welcome to open issues and pull requests and share your own contributions Certainly your team's efforts will be highly appreciated and recognized.
