**Challenge:** The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activity in India. Until mid-March 2020, the economy was mainly hit by disruptions in cross-border connections. When COVID-19 started to spread in India through domestic contagion, the Indian authorities enacted a series of measures to combat the pandemic, including a strict national lockdown from March 25 to May 4 that strongly disrupted economic activity across the country. This study estimates the impact of a differential relaxation of COVID-19 containment policies on aggregate economic activity in India.

**Solution**: To conduct this analysis, pandemic-era district level data are used from a range of novel sources â€“ monthly nighttime lights from global satellites, mobility data from individual smartphone locations from Facebook, and high frequency household-level survey data on income and consumption.

[Facebook Disease Prevention Maps](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/) mobility data is used to measure the impact of these local containment policies on movement. The regional lockdown strategy has caused a greater and sharper decline in mobility than the national lockdown in April. For the first time, the pattern in Danang has diverged from that in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC); this was not the case in preceding months, where changes in all three cities occured uniformly.

**Impact**: Continued resurgences of COVID-19 infections have amplified the need for just-in-time policy responses. Localized lockdown has led to a more rapid and efficient curtailment of movement, compared to the national lockdown. This enables Vietnam to both limit the economic impact and a possible spread of contagion, as well as to potentially reopen faster than it would from a national lockdown.
