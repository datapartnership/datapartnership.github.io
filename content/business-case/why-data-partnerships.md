Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges in linking the supply of proprietary data and the demand for these data for public benefit.

On the supply side, companies that have warrant to share data may not have the resources to ensure third-party analyses are performed in a secure and ethical manner. At the same time, since many applications for a company’s data may fall outside their sector expertise, and since solutions may require a combination of proprietary datasets across a range of competitors, individual companies are not necessarily well-positioned create optimal solutions to public sector challenges.

On the demand side --from academics, NGOs, governments, and international organizations – there is discord. A company may be approached daily with requests from dozens of actors. For mid-size and small companies especially, the burden of responding to this disaggregated demand can be overwhelming – processing requests, understanding needs, signing bilateral legal agreements, assigning technical staff to respond to questions, ensuring data security – all of which would be outside the scope of the company’s core business.
