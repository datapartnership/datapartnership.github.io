High frequency, timely, and granular information -- which is routinely collected by the private sector--can help inform public policy and service delivery. Accessing and using such data responsibly has been challenging, for various administrative reasons. The Development Data Partnership—a new consortium founded by the World Bank, IMF, and IADB—provides the market, legal, and technical infrastructure necessary to facilitate public-private data partnerships for public good at scale. During this event, the founding organizations and several private data partners, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Facebook, Google, MapBox, and Veraset, will introduce the program and its achievements. The event aims to raise awareness about the importance of responsible public-private sector data collaboration for policymaking and international development. Join this event to learn more about the Partnership's successful model of public-private sector collaboration.
