This has proven to be a busy yet fulfilling year for the [Development Data Partnership](www.datapartnerhsip.org) (the Partnership).  As we bid farewell to 2024, we reflect on a year marked by impactful projects and fruitful partnerships. Join us as we look at this year's key highlights.


## Fostering Collaborative Success 

Collaboration is crucial to our work, as we cannot achieve our goals alone. The Partnership has continued to collaborate with its network of data and development partners. This year, we introduced a new agreement to facilitate data sharing between international organizations. We also welcomed our new partners: [IDB Invest](https://www.idbinvest.org/en), [EarthGenome](https://www.earthgenome.org), [Constellr](https://www.constellr.com/), [QuantCube](https://www.quant-cube.com/), and [VesselBot](https://www.vesselbot.com/).


We are excited to have such great partnerships that reflect our dedication to unleashing the power of data sharing for the public good. Our current and new partners represent diverse sectors, and their contributions have extended our reach within the data community, strengthening our impact.

## Engaging with the Data Community

Our Development Data Partnership Day was held in May 2024 at the OECD Headquarters and Conference Centre in Paris. The event was both exciting and insightful, bringing together participants from international organizations and the private sector. It featured an impressive lineup of speakers, including experts from the tech industry, journalists, economists, and data scientists. The sessions explored a wide range of topics, from leveraging the power of AI to enhancing public-private data collaboration for the greater public good.

## Promoting Data Collaboration for Sustainable Development

Data is a key driver for sustainable development. Tech companies are essential in addressing international development challenges by sharing high-quality data and expertise with data scientists, policymakers, and other data practitioners. Over the year, the Partnership has supported nearly 100 projects. 

This year, we have also [published almost 30 impact stories](https://datapartnership.org/updates/) showcasing the results and impact of the collaboration with the private sector. Here’s a look back at some of the stories.

- **Artificial intelligence (AI)** offers numerous benefits to the financial sector but can also introduce new forms of financial stability risks.
