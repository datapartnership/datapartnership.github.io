The Development Data Partnership has been designed to overcome these supply and demand challenges at scale. Specifically, the Partnership: (a) coordinates and aggregates demand on behalf of public actors; (b) links public sector challenges and domain expertise to relevant proprietary data; (c) significantly reduces the transaction costs associated with data sharing; (d) reduces duplication of effort and facilitates collaboration on development of solutions; and (e) increases transparency and accountability for integrating use of proprietary data in public good analytics.

By learning through real world project implementation, the Partnership aims to transform proprietary datasets into sustainably generated, sharable insights for improving public sector services and infrastructure.
