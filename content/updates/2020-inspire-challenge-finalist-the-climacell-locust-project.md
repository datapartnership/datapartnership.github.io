Ag Observatory in collaboration with the World Bank Data Lab guided and facilitated Climacell's entry into the CGIAR [Big Data Inspire Challenge 2020](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/inspire/ "Big Data Challenge"). The ClimaCell Locust Project has been nominated as a finalist in the 2020 Inspire Challenge.

The winners and finalists of the 2020 [Inspire Challenge](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/inspire/ "Inspire Challenge") were announced at the virtual [Big Data in Agriculture Convention](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/virtual-convention-2020/ "convention") “Digital Dynamism for Adaptive Food Systems”. As a winner, the Locust project has received an initial grant of USD100,000.

The Locust project proposes to develop 360-degree locust monitoring tool that leverages ClimaCell.co’s weather intelligence engine. The tool will be developed with end users and farmers to monitor all key aspects and share early warnings, increasing countries’ capacity to prepare and respond early and effectively to locust swarms.
