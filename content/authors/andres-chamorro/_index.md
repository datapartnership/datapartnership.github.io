I’m a geographer currently working for the World Bank’s Geospatial Operations Support Team. I’m passionate about leveraging the unique data resources of today to tackle complex social and environmental issues. I’m a nimble programmer with a strong foundation in remote sensing, spatial econometrics, and a good eye for organizing data in compelling layouts.

In the past, I managed a unique dataset used to forecast food insecurity risk in conflict-ridden areas (Famine Action Mechanism), and provided GIS support to an innovative platform producing deforestation alerts from satellite imagery (Global Forest Watch).

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and watching soccer (always rooting for the underdog).
