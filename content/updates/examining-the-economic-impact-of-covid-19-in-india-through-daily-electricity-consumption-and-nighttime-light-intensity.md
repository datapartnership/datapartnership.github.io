**Challenge:** The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activity in India. Until mid-March 2020, the economy was mainly hit by disruptions in cross-border connections. When COVID-19 started to spread in India through domestic contagion, the Indian authorities enacted a series of measures to combat the pandemic, including a strict national lockdown from March 25 to May 4 that strongly disrupted economic activity across the country. This study estimates the impact of a differential relaxation of COVID-19 containment policies on aggregate economic activity in India.

**Solution**: To conduct this analysis, pandemic-era district level data are used from a range of novel sources â€“ monthly nighttime lights from global satellites, mobility data from individual smartphone locations from Facebook, and high frequency household-level survey data on income and consumption.

Nighttime light intensity in India dimmed during the strict national lockdown in March and April and recovered in May and subsequent months. In May, districts with the most severe restrictions witnessed a 12.4% (0.06 standard deviation) lower recovery in light intensity compared to those with the least restrictions.

The recovery for districts with intermediate restrictions was 1.7% (0.01 standard deviation) lower. Our findings are robust to several logically orthogonal robustness checks. These include a test of the impact of the zonal classification on the pre-period, where we reassuringly find no eect. We restrict the sample to only those districts that border a differently classified zone, to non-metropolitan districts, and those that were

not subsequently reclassified in mid-May, and find no qualitative change in our results. Finally, a test with

placebo zone classifications yields coecients that are close to zero and insignificant. While remaining in

the same direction, the impact of the zone classification tapered o in June and July. Facebook mobility data

from cellphone locations indicates that restricted mobility is a plausible channel causing lower household

income and consumption, which in turn explains the aggregate impact. More developed districts with above

median population density, share of employment in services, credit per capita, and mean age experienced

larger impacts of the restrictions.

**Impact**: Continued resurgences of COVID-19 infections have amplified the need for just-in-time policy responses. Localized lockdown has led to a more rapid and efficient curtailment of movement, compared to the national lockdown. This enables Vietnam to both limit the economic impact and a possible spread of contagion, as well as to potentially reopen faster than it would from a national lockdown.
