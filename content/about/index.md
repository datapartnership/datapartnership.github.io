The **Development Data Partnership** is a collaboration between international organizations and technology companies, facilitating the efficient and responsible use of third-party data in international development.

The *Partnership*’s success is predicated on our standardized legal, IT, and governance procedures, as well as our vibrant data science community.

*Partnership* activities are guided by a *Board*, with representation from each international development partner, as well as a *Strategic Advisory Group*, with representation from donors and technology partners. Day-to-day management is led by the Partnership’s *Secretariat* and working groups – legal, IT, and data science. These governance bodies – and the invaluable contributions of their members -- make possible our seamless coordination between international organizations and private firms for public good.
