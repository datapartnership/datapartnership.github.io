**Challenge:** The worst locust upsurge in at least 25 years is hitting parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Western Asia, and over 40 million people who are already food insecure find their food supply and livelihoods threatened.

In collaboration with the Development Data Partnership and AG Observatory, ClimaCell has taken on the challenge of adapting their weather intelligence platform and advanced predictive weather technology to develop the capability to manage and mitigate the spread of locusts.

**Solution**: ClimaCell’s mobile friendly solutions are being shaped to overcome three major challenges. First, historical and predictive weather technology will highlight hyperlocal areas to be sprayed with pesticides where locust eggs and populations are likely to grow quickly, significantly reducing any unnecessary and harmful spraying to people and livestock. Second, trajectory model will show where existing swarms of locusts are likely migrating to next, updating in real-time and with the ability for people to send SMS confirming locust locations via crowdsourcing. Finally, alerting features will allow for early warnings to farmers and communities well in advance of incoming swarms with recommendations on what action needs to be taken and when.

**Impact**: Using the hackathon model, ClimaCell’s team of meteorologists, data scientists and product engineers from across the world dedicated 24 hours to this critical challenge. Activities leading up to the event involved problem scoping and sharing of insights by experts from the World Bank, FAO, and others. Critical input was also received from members of the development sector such as the Red Cross as well as African farmers and pastoralists. During the event, rapid product iteration took place based on real time inputs from African farming and emergency response community members, leading to a community-built solution with the goal of being complementary and additive to existing solutions.
