Public policy and provision of public infrastructure and services are heavily dependent on data â€“ higher quality, timely data translates into more effective sector and program prioritization, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.

Increasingly, the private sector is generating data that could be used to complement traditional public-sector data collection methods. Through public-private collaboration, in addition to generating more timely and relevant data for decision making, entirely new public good use cases could be discovered and implemented.

By learning through real world project implementation, the Partnership transforms proprietary datasets into sustainably generated, sharable insights for improving public sector services and infrastructure.
