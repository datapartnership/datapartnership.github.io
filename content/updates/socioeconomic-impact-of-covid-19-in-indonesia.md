**Challenge**: Although there is a widespread awareness of the pandemic, there is a lack of understanding from citizensâ€™ perspective, especially behaviors it triggers, sentiments towards government as well as rising concerns. Premise survey data along with data from other big data sources such as social media, online news, and other crowdsourcing platforms are analyzed to understand economic and health concerns, and food security. This is an activity under the COVID-19 Observatory in partnership with the Poverty GP.

**Solution**: Premise crowdsourcing data collection phone application was utilized to study COVID-19 related health and economic concerns. Nearly 23,500 Indonesians participated in the survey. The questionnaire covered topics such as economics (outlook, business, goods), social aspects (distancing, media, and travel), and health (spread, care, and testing) related to COVID-19.

In populations surveyed, there is a high level of knowledge on COVID-19, with most respondents aware of common symptoms and preventative health measures. In particular, use of social media for information is common. However, citizens face challenges in following public health, social distancing, and self-isolation measures.

When compared across different data collection efforts, it is found that World Bank online survey findings on knowledge and awareness are consistent with Premise survey and other surveys such as J-PAL, BPS, Warwick, and YouGov. Moreover, survey results are also confirmed with mobility insights from big data analytics. The mobility of people in hotspot locations has tremendously decreased and people tend to stay at home following travel ban policy and lockdown restrictions.

**Impact**: Concerns related to COVID-19 have revolved around health care, food access, job loss and government handling. Premise data acts as a vital source of crowdsourced information via online survey to understand people's concerns and behaviour during the pandemic.
