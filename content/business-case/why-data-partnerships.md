There is a persistent market failure in the international development community between the supply of private sector data and the demand for its use.

On the supply side, companies engaged in a range of businesses – e.g., ridesharing, social media, financial transactions, retail, shipping, mobile operators – generate data that can be repurposed for public good. However, since that “public good” may be in a sector outside the firm’s expertise, identifying an efficient public use would require intervention of a third party.

On the demand side, companies are approached daily with data requests from academics, NGOs, governments, and international organizations. For mid-size and small companies especially, the burden of responding to this disaggregated demand can be overwhelming – processing requests, understanding needs, signing bilateral legal agreements, assigning technical staff to respond to questions, ensuring data security – all of which would be outside the scope of the company’s core business objectives.
