As the COVID-19 pandemic proliferates, so have measures to mitigate its spread. Physical distancing and [movement restrictions](https://ourworldindata.org/policy-responses-covid#restrictions-on-internal-movement) – such as school and workplace closures, public event cancellations, stay-at-home orders, and international and domestic travel bans – vary considerably [across countries](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33754/Determinants-of-Social-Distancing-and-Economic-Activity-during-COVID-19-A-Global-View.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

Since movement restrictions themselves can have profoundly negative impacts on communities, it is essential for governments to understand which policies have the most and least effective impacts.

Anonymized “mobility data” – GPS data generated primarily from smartphones – may support efforts to limit movement restriction measures to those most needed, by painting a better picture of population frequency of movement, distance of movement relative to home, daily commuting patterns, inter-district flows, and social mixing.

A number of companies have generously made these data available, either publicly or through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/), to support COVID-19 response programs.

With so many new sources of information, it can be difficult to know where to start. To overcome this challenge, the Partnership, in collaboration with the World Bank Sustainable Development Data Lab and Health Global Practice, created a Mobile Location Data Inventory, which shows the availability of 17 mobility-related datasets in 90 developing economies.
