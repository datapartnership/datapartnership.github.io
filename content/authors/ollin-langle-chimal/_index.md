Ollin is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He earned his PhD in Complex Systems and Data Science from the University of Vermont (UVM). His PhD research included applications of data science and mathematical modeling for social good, focusing particularly on the social and economic inequalities following the COVID-19 pandemic, a topic he explored during his internships at The World Bank. He is deeply interested in using data science, machine learning, and mathematical modeling in decision-making processes to develop preventive tools and mitigate inequalities that affect the most vulnerable populations. This interest has also led Ollin to work as a data scientist for the Mexican Ministry of Social Development and THINKMD, a global health startup dedicated to expanding access to health services in low-income countries.
