**Challenge:** Ukraine, Europe’s biggest country, has over 1,192 operators and providers, of which close to three quarters operate under a special preferential tax regime, allowing them not to report their coverage/subscription data to the national telecom regulatory authority. As a result, the current coverage data, especially of fixed broadband, are deemed highly inaccurate. As the government needs to set high-speed broadband coverage goals and estimate financing needs for a public investment program, it is important to validate existing data and evaluate broadband coverage.

**Solution**: [Facebook Disease Prevention Maps](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disease-prevention-maps/) mobility data is used to measure the impact of these local containment policies on movement. The regional lockdown strategy has caused a greater and sharper decline in mobility than the national lockdown in April. For the first time, the pattern in Danang has diverged from that in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC); this was not the case in preceding months, where changes in all three cities occured uniformly.

**Impact**: Broadband connectivity is a critical foundation for socioeconomic development in today’s global, and increasingly digital, economy. It is a general-purpose technology (GPT) that accelerates the pace of economic growth and reduces income disparities, thus contributing to poverty alleviation. This enables Vietnam to both limit the economic impact and a possible spread of contagion, as well as to potentially reopen faster than it would from a national lockdown.
