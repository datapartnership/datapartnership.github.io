**Challenge:** Although there is a widespread awareness of the pandemic, there is a lack of understanding from citizensâ€™ perspective, especially behaviors it triggers, sentiments towards government as well as rising concerns. Premise survey data along with data from other big data sources such as social media, online news, and other crowdsourcing platforms are analyzed to understand economic and health concerns, and food security. This is a project under the COVID-19 Observatory in partnership with the Poverty GP.

**Solution:** Premise crowdsourcing data collection phone application was utilized to study COVID-19 related health and economic concerns, in particular to cross-check World Bank Online Survey results against it. The PREMISE questionnaire covered topics such as economics (outlook, business, goods), social aspects (distancing, media, and travel), and health (spread, care, and testing) related to COVID-19, and covered 2,749 Indonesians respondents, while World Bank Online Survey covered 3,375 respondents.
