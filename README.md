# datapartnership.org

This repo contains the code and deployment details for the datapartnership.org site.

Please check the Wiki for details on how the site works, where to deploy it and how. There is also a  quick guide for developing and editing the theme.

Content are in a wiki instead of readme/deploy/dev files in order to avoid un-necessary site builds once the documentation is edited.

Please contact hkrambeck@worldbank.org to be added to netlify/forestry or any other resources.
